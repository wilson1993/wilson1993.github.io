GAINESVILLE — Memories remained fresh on the mind only a week after the 13th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. A packed house awaited the remarks of a noted speaker, sure to bring some comfort among the tension.
On Thursday, John L. Esposito, professor of religion and international affairs and of Islamic studies at Georgetown University, gave a speech at the University of Florida. 
The Bob Graham Center for Public Service filled up early for the speaker. Cameras were set up all around the room and eager listeners rocked side to side in their seats. 
Esposito finally took the stage. 
He joked about the nervous looks on audience members faces. The room finally withdrew the anxiety that it was displaying and the audience watched on with a thoughtful eye.
A reflection on the previous state of Islam in America from Esposito brought forth nods across the aisles. “In the 70s, the sense of America was Catholic, Protestant, and Jews,” said Esposito.
Esposito thought the point that most Americans began to pay attention to Islamic culture came alongside the Iranian revolution in 1979.
Cameras were being pointed in on the turmoil stirring in the Middle East, displaying not only frightening images of hostility toward America, but also blatant American ignorance.
Media outlets ignored some of the most prominent sensitivities that Islamic cultures work to install in their everyday lives, said Esposito. 
However, Americans only focused on the picture broadcasted through their televisions, one that saw Islamic cultures as anti-American war machines.
This was the first widespread impression Islam made on Americans. 
Then, in 2001, Americans once again found Islam in the spotlight as extreme terrorist organizations hijacked commercial planes and flew them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a Pennsylvania field. America and the world was shocked. 
Once again, Islamic people were thrown into the spotlight, many of them being profiled for the actions that terrorists committed, Esposito said. 
Not all Islamic people are terrorists, added Esposito. Many of them strive to reach goals of Americans, especially the freedoms Americans enjoy. 
“The people who hate us for who we are, are the terrorists,” said Esposito.
As the world becomes more globalized, more people will have to interact with more races and religions than ever before. 
For that reason, we must learn to become more tolerant, said Esposito. 
“All religions have a dark side. The difference is, I compare my ideal to someone else’s reality,” said Esposito.

                <p>GAINESVILLE – Amendment two could smoke out extra voters from their house to come to the polls this Election Day.
	The medical marijuana bill would open new alternatives to existing medical treatments. Residents of Florida would be able to buy and use marijuana after being prescribed by a physician. 
	The bill would not allow for the patient to cultivate their own plants, said Robert Capecchi, deputy director of state policy at the Marijuana Policy Project. 
	Floridians would have to go to state regulated dispensaries in order to obtain their prescriptions. 
	Amendment two would be more open than the existing senate bill 1030, which Gov. Rick Scott signed in June. Bill 1030 allows patients with debilitating diseases to access cannabis with low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. THC is the element in marijuana that produces a euphoric state. 
	Physicians would be able to prescribe cannabis that was not necessarily low in THC for patients under amendment two. More diseases would be covered as well, diseases that are not cancerous or produce seizures.
	The bill is expected to bring out a lot of young and older voters alike, said Capecchi. 
	“It’s a non-partisan issue, I just want to bring out voters.”
	However, this non-partisan issue may have an influence on the governor race. 
	Support for Amendment two has declined nearing the November election. The bill, which needs 60 percent of votes to pass, has lost momentum since earlier in the year. A St. Pete Polls survey released on Nov. 2 had the bill only showing 53.8 percent of voters in support. 
	Although he passed Bill 1030, Scott is against amendment two, wanting more time to work out how the system should be executed before expanding the boundaries of legalization. 
	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist on the other hand, is in favor of the issue. 
	“I support the medical marijuana amendment. And the reason I do is I think it is the compassionate thing to do,” said Crist during a gubernatorial debate on Oct. 21.
	The medical marijuana bill will be decided on Nov. 4, alongside the race for governor.
	Both governors have shown support for some level for the use of medical marijuana out of compassion for the sick.
	“If it benefits some really sick people, then I say go for it,” said Capecchi
